The technically interesting thing our game achieves is a unique take on physics
for endless runners. Our core mechanic idea was to have the player control a platform
or part of the environment, rather than the main character itself, and guide the
character through obstacles to safety. The implemented system lets you control a
butler who changes into 4 different forms that bounce the character high, low, right
and left. This mechanic was a challenge to achieve, but absolutely worth it.

The interesting parts of our game with regard to art are definitely the art style and
original sound effects. Yeni said she had never done sound effects before, but she did
an excellent job nailing our cute-but-weird feel. They perfectly match Ben's unique
take on the butler, bunny, and monster, which all really make our game stand out in a
great way. The different bounce forms of the butler and animation for the monster 
enhance this feeling even further. The monster chomping as it tracks the bunny makes 
gameplay all that much more suspenseful.
